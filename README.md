# Écosystème du cyclisme pour les femmes en France

## Introduction:
The goal of this project is to conduct an end-to-end analysis focused on female cyclists in France, incorporating both data science and data analytics techniques. By examining various aspects of cycling, including equipment usage, participation in events, infrastructure, and financial implications, we aim to gain insights into the needs and challenges of female cyclists, as well as the economic impact of cycling initiatives. The project includes a finance component into the project, focusing on analyzing the financial aspects of female cycling in France. This includes budgeting for cycling equipment, assessing the economic impact of cycling events, and optimizing pricing strategies for cycling products. Additional data sources such as financial transactions, economic indicators, and market research reports will be leveraged to provide comprehensive insights into the financial landscape of female cycling.

## Business Case
This project centers around a sporting goods store, such as Décathlon, with a focus on understanding the needs and challenges of female cyclists in France. The business case will involve analyzing data from multiple sources, including flat files, web scraping, APIs, and big data systems, to provide actionable insights for the store's marketing, product development, and financial management strategies.

## Datasets Used
- Flat File:
   Cycling accident data in France, which can be obtained from government agencies or open data portals.
   Purchase records from the sporting goods store, Decathlon, including bike and bike-related products bought by female customers.
  
- Web Scraping:
  Gather data from cycling forums, blogs, and social media platforms to understand the discussions, concerns, and preferences of female cyclists in France.
  Extract information from cycling event websites or cycling clubs focusing on women's participation.

- API:
  Utilize APIs provided by relevant organizations or government agencies to fetch data related to cycling infrastructure, bike routes, and bike-sharing programs specifically catering to women in France.

- Big Data System:
  Explore big data sources, such as streaming data from cycling apps or fitness trackers used by female cyclists in France.
  Aggregate data from multiple sources, such as IoT devices installed on bikes, to analyze usage patterns and preferences.

## Methodologies
- Data Collection:
  - Collect and compile data from flat files, web scraping, APIs, and big data systems.
  - Ensure the data collected covers aspects such as cycling accidents, purchases, discussions, infrastructure, routes, and usage patterns.
- Data Cleaning and Wrangling:
  - Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the collected datasets.
  - Standardize data formats and resolve any data quality issues.
  - Implement advanced data cleaning techniques, such as using machine learning algorithms for imputing missing data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Perform exploratory analysis to understand the distributions, trends, and relationships within the data.
  - Identify key factors influencing female cyclists' behavior and preferences.
- Feature Engineering:
  - Create new features or derive meaningful metrics from the existing data to enhance predictive modeling or analysis.
- Machine Learning:
  - Implement machine learning models to forecast financial trends related to female cycling, enabling predictive analysis and strategic planning.
- Data Visualization:
  - Visualize the findings from the EDA phase using charts, graphs, and maps to communicate insights effectively.
  - Create visualizations that highlight differences and trends specific to female cyclists in France.
- Statistical Analysis:
  - Apply statistical techniques to analyze the data and identify significant patterns or correlations.
  - Conduct hypothesis testing to validate assumptions about female cyclists' preferences and behaviors.
  - Explore time series analysis to understand seasonal variations in cycling behavior among women.
- Financial Application:
  - Apply portfolio optimization techniques to optimize investment decisions in cycling-related ventures, considering factors such as risk tolerance and return objectives.
  - Conduct risk assessment and scenario analysis to identify potential financial risks associated with cycling investments and develop mitigation strategies accordingly.
- Dashboard Development:
  - Develop interactive dashboards using visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI to provide stakeholders with actionable insights.
  - Include key metrics, trends, and recommendations for the sporting goods store based on the analysis.
- Predictive Modeling (Optional for Data Analytics):
  - Build predictive models, such as regression or classification models, to forecast demand for specific bike products among female customers.
  - Evaluate model performance and refine models based on feedback and additional data.
